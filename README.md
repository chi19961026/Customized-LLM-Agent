# End-to-End Customized LLM Agent: Leveraging LLMs for Efficient Data & Prompt Refinement

## Project Overview:
This project is dedicated to developing a customized chatbot using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT models, specifically designed to handle customer service FAQs. Originally intended for a B2B consulting company to provide expert responses based on the company's in-house domain knowledge, this project has been repurposed for demonstration to manage e-commerce customer service FAQ data.

## Project Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can efficiently answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) by leveraging the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM). The project revolves around two main tasks:
#### 1. Quantitative Evaluation and Efficient Training Process:
To improve training efficiency, this project mimics the structure of the 3rd party chatbot system, which currently lacks quantitative evaluation metrics, making the process manual and biased. By replicating their model and using the METEOR score as the key evaluation metric, the project aims to streamline and enhance the training process.
#### 2. Optimizing Data Input for 3rd Party Chatbot Systems:
This project focuses on refining the input data to improve its quality before being fed into the 3rd party chatbot system. Through thorough data preprocessing, generating high-quality embeddings, and optimizing prompts, the goal is to ensure that the chatbot delivers the most accurate and relevant responses.

## Key Components of the Process:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Collecting data from various sources and transforming it into a unified structure that enhances training performance.
2. **Embedding Model**: Generating embeddings for the given data using OpenAI's API to enable question and answer functionality based on embedding search.
3. **Trained Chatbot with Customized Instruction**: Utilizing OpenAI's Chat Completion API with specified chatbot instructions.
4. **Quantitative Testing & Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using quantitative metrics, focusing on the METEOR score due to its robustness in accounting for synonyms and paraphrasing, making it particularly suitable for natural language generation tasks.

## Outcome:
The result of this project is a well-optimized, efficient customer service chatbot ready to be integrated with a 3rd party chatbot system. The projectâ€™s process ensures that both the data and the chatbot's performance are refined to the highest standards, facilitating better customer interactions and streamlined training.
