# OpenAI-Customized-Chatbot
This project focuses on developing a customized chatbot using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT models. The chatbot is designed to handle FAQs and provide relevant responses based on the input data. Originally designed for a B2B consulting company to provide expert responses based on the company's in-house domain knowledge, this project has been transformed for demonstration purposes to handle e-commerce customer service FAQ data.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can efficiently answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) by leveraging the capabilities of the GPT model. The project involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Collecting data from various sources and transforming it into a unified structure that enhances training performance.
2. **Embedding Model:** Generating embeddings for the given data using OpenAI's API to enable question and answer functionality based on embedding search.
3. **Trained Chatbot with Customized Instruction:** Utilizing OpenAI's Chat Completion API with specified chatbot instructions.
4. **Testing Using Quantitative Models:** Evaluating the performance of the chatbot's responses using BLEU Score, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and METEOR as testing score metrics.
